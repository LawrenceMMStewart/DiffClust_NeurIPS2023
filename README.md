#### Contents:

In the `src` repository one has access to:

- `clustercomparison.py`: generates a grid of figures displaying the toy-clustering data sets and methods.
- `_fullysup.py`: trains a model using the differentiable clustering frame work in the fully supervised setting. The prefix `cifar` corresponds to the **CIFAR-10** data set (the backbone is ResNet50) and the prefix `nist` corresponds to the **MNIST** and **Fashion MNIST** data sets (the backbone is LeNet5).
- `_fullsup_baseline` : same as above, but trains the baseline model using the cross-entropy loss.
- `_semisup.py` : same as ``_fullysup.py``, but in the semi-supervised learning setting (with optional class hold-out).
- `_semisup_baseline.py` : same as the above, but for the baseline model.
